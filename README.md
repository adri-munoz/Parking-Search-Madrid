# Parking-Search-Madrid

# Overview

Parking Search Madrid is an iOS application that helps users find street and garage parking spots in Madrid, focusing primarily on the ZBEDEP (Zero/Low Emissions Zone) area.

As you cannot park on the street within the ZBEDEP area unless you have a special permit, the app enables the user to find the closest garages or closest streets (outside the ZBEDEP) to a searched location.

The app also enables to save records of the parking tickets obtained during parking in a garage for future reference and appeal a penalty in case the parking record is not properly processed by the government.
