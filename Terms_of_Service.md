# Terms & Conditions

These terms and conditions apply to the Parking Search Madrid app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by Adrian Muñoz (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a free service.

Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. 

## App Functionality

The Application is designed to help users locate parking spots in Madrid and maintain records of parking tickets for personal reference. The Application provides links to third-party services like Google Maps and Waze for navigation. The Service Provider is not responsible for the content or functionality of these external services.

## User Responsibilities

1. **Personal Data:** The Application stores and processes personal data that you provide to ensure functionality, such as saving parking ticket records. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device and access to the Application.

2. **Device Security:** The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as this could compromise your device’s security features and potentially cause the Application to malfunction.

3. **Internet Connection:** Certain functions of the Application require an active internet connection. The Service Provider is not liable for issues arising from lack of access to Wi-Fi, mobile data, or if your data allowance is exhausted.

4. **Usage Costs:** If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, you are responsible for any charges incurred from your mobile network provider, including roaming data charges if applicable. Ensure you have permission from the bill payer to use the Application if you are not the bill payer for your device.

5. **Device Maintenance:** It is your responsibility to ensure your device remains charged and in working condition. The Service Provider is not liable for loss of access to the Application due to device-related issues.

## Liability

The Service Provider strives to ensure that the Application is updated and accurate. However, the Service Provider relies on third-party data sources and accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, arising from reliance on the Application’s functionality.

The Application is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. The Service Provider is not liable for any penalties incurred due to parking violations or incorrect data within the Application.

## Updates and Termination

The Service Provider may update the Application to improve its functionality or compatibility with new operating system versions. Users agree to accept these updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider may also cease providing the Application at any time without prior notice.
