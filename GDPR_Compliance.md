Parking Search Madrid is committed to complying with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This document explains how we handle personal data, ensure user rights, and comply with GDPR obligations.

## 1. **Data Controller**
The data controller for Parking Search Madrid is:
- **Name:** Adrian Muñoz  
- **Email:** adrian@amr-ventures.com  

## 2. **Data We Process**
The app processes the following personal data:
- **Photos and Camera Access**: Used for capturing parking tickets, stored locally on the user’s device.  
- **No Location Data**: The app does not collect or store location data.  
- **No External Data Storage**: All data is stored locally on the user’s device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## 3. **Lawful Basis for Data Processing**
- **Consent:** Users grant consent by choosing to use the app and explicitly allowing camera access.  
- **Legitimate Interests:** Data processing is necessary for core app functionality (e.g., saving parking records).

## 4. **User Rights**
Users have the following rights under GDPR:
- **Right of Access:** Users can view all data stored on their device through the app interface.  
- **Right to Rectification:** Users can edit or update parking records within the app.  
- **Right to Erasure:** Users can delete parking records directly from the app.  
- **Right to Restrict Processing:** The app processes no external data, so this right is inherently respected.  
- **Right to Data Portability:** Since data is stored locally, users have full control over it without restrictions.  
- **Right to Object:** Users can stop using the app and delete it from their devices at any time.

## 5. **Data Security**
The app stores all data locally on the user's device using SwiftData. No personal data is shared, uploaded, or processed externally.  

## 6. **Breach Notification**
As the app does not process or store data externally, the risk of a data breach is minimized. If any breach of app functionality occurs, users will be notified via the App Store or email (if applicable).

## 7. **Third-Party Services**
- The app links to external services like Google Maps and Waze. These services operate independently and have their own GDPR compliance policies.
